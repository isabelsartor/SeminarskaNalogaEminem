<h1>EMINEM</h1>
<h2> Who is Eminem?  </h2>
<p> Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972) known professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Central America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Eminem's global success and acclaimed works by him are widely regarded as having broken down the racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Although much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he has become a representation of the popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.</p>

<h2> Life </h2>
<p> During his childhood, Eminem and his mother commuted between Detroit and Missouri, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living mostly with family members. As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father. Debbie (his mother of him)
  He said they all came back marked "returned to sender." When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident Eminem later chronicled in the song "Brain Damage."

Debbie filed a public school lawsuit over this in 1982. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, mostly black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white families in their neighborhood, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. Eminem heard his first rap song on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkingharn.

When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and didn't attend his funeral. When her son became famous, Debbie dismissed the criticism, saying she had protected him and was responsible for her success. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne "Kim" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem entered into an on and off relationship with Scott.

Though interested in English, Eminem never explored literature and disliked math and social studies. Eminem worked various jobs to help his mother pay the bills. Eminem snuck into nearby Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for freestyle rap battles in the cafeteria. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was liked by underground hip hop audiences.

Though the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes. </p>

Dre, who launched him into the music business with the single "My Name Is" and later set up a record label called Shady Records, working with 50 Cent and Yelawolf.His acting career began in 2002 with the famous film 8Mile, obtaining the following year the Oscar thanks to his unreleased film "Lose Yourself".
